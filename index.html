              85% of SEN parents believe that excelling in academics instils pride, self-confidence and leads to inclusiveness (as per Survey Conducted, Participate in survey).
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              Growth of Edtech platforms coupled with COVID 19 pandemic has irreversibly changed the education delivery to a hybrid model (online + in-person) involving more and more online tools and technologies. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              Traditionally supplemental education delivery for SEN children happens as a 1-on-1 in-person session through trained Special Educators (SE). This places SEN children and their guardians at a significant disadvantage to leverage the modern Edtech tools. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              Our research highlights :
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>No SEN children focussed Edtech platform exists today.</li>
              <li>SE focused on specialised Middle and Secondary supplemental education are scarce and inaccessible.</li>
              <li>Parents take on average Six months to find a suitable Special Educator! (Discovery problem).</li>
              <li>Parents are outcome focussed and willing to embrace any type of intervention; online or offline. </li>
              <li>Average spend on a SEN child is 4X of other children.</li>
              <li>Parents are looking for interventions enabling self-regulation.</li>
              <li>Engagement is poor & ineffective in the present online setups due to absence of feedback mechanism.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">
              The above clearly suggests that it is difficult to find out the right SE (Discovery issue); It is expensive ( Price sensitivity);  especially for middle and higher class students, specialised lack of skilled SEs (Supply & demand gap); engagement is ineffective in an online environment.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              The lacunae of the present system will be offset by taking this engagement online while effectively <b>determining & managing attention</b> of the child whilst a session is being conducted to deliver enhanced learning outcomes. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">
             This framework of online education for SEN children can be enabled by creating a closed loop feedback system that monitors and measures attention; assists children in self regulation and enables teachers to take corrective measures continuously. This technology (and operational model) needs to be personalised, humanised, and effective!

            <!-- <hr> -->
            <p class="text">
              Children with SEN are not able to cope up with the academic pressure and need innovative solutions to make their learning more effective, personalised and outcome oriented.
